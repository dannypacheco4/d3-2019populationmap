# D3-2019 Population

## About:
I created a site that utilizes D3's library to create an interactive US map that displays state and county population using US Census api. You can filter the state population by race, and clicking a state shows the population of each county for it.
This map is customizable with different population data if the US census api provides the given year. Hope you enjoy using my webapp and thank you for checking out my repo!
